Professional Document Templates
===============================

This repository contains LaTeX templates to help 
in the creation of clean and presentable yet simple 
professional documents. 

With these templates you can have a good starting 
point for the structure of your document, and focus 
mainly on the content, (following the good LaTeX philosophy).

Normally I create a generic full professional profile document 
which I then use to create smaller custom resumes as needed.

### How to use the templates?
* Refer to the **professional_profile/examples** directory to get started 
creating your professional profile.
* Refer to the **resume/examples directory** to get started 
creating your resume.
