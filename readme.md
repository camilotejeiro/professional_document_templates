Professional Document Templates
===============================

This repository contains LaTeX templates to help 
in the creation of clean and presentable yet simple 
professional documents. 

With these templates you can have a good starting 
point for the structure of your document, and focus 
mainly on the content, (following the good LaTeX philosophy).
